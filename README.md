# Refresh Icons
_Compatible with iOS 5, 6 and 7+_

Copyright (c) 2014 bitst0rm

Introduction
------------
_Refresh Icons_ will fix the missing or corrupted white/blank app icons. This issue happens when you install apps on a jailbroken iOS Device. It is not clear if it is due to the jailbreak or due to a problematic or incompatible jailbreak tweak. It looks like the issue crops up when the `com.apple.mobile.installation.plist` does not load properly.

There are no options or settings to configure. Simple tap on the Refresh Icons icon to go.
